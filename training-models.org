* Research Questions

Can we have the LLMs (i.e., Llama) learn to read secret documents?  Can we have the models read other languages?

* Design an Experiment

If we ask the Llama to tell us a secret, what would they tell us? Initially, they usually respond the model does not know any secret.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  M-x shell
  ollama pull zephyr

  M-x ellama-chat
  Please tell me a secret.

#+end_src


Here is the resonse from the model.
